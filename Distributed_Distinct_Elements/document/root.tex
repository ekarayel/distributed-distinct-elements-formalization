\abstract{This entry formalizes a randomized cardinality esimation data structure with 
asymptotically optimal space usage. It is inspired by the streaming algorithm presented by 
B\l{}asiok~\cite{blasiok2020} in 2018. His work closed the gap between the best-known lower
bound and upper bound after a long line of research started by Flajolet and 
Martin~\cite{flajolet1982} in 1984 and was to first to apply expander graphs (in addition to hash
families) to the problem. The formalized algorithm has two improvements compared to the 
algorithm by B\l{}asiok. It supports operation in parallel mode, and it relies on a simpler 
pseudo-random construction avoiding the use of code based extractors.}
