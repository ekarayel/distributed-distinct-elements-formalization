\title{Expander Graphs}
\author{Emin Karayel}
\maketitle

\abstract{Expander Graphs are low-degree graphs that are highly connected. The concept has diverse 
applications, for example in derandomization and pseudo-randomness, error-correcting codes, as well 
as pure mathematical subjects such as metric embeddings. This entry formalizes the notion and
derives standard results about the distribution of random walks on exander graphs, such as the 
hitting property. Moreover strongly explicit constructions for every size and spectral gap are 
constructed. The latter is based on the Margulis-Gabber-Galil graphs and several graph operations
that preserve spectral properties of the graph. The proofs are based on the survey papers/monographs
by Hoory et al.~\cite{hoory2006} and Vadhan~\cite{vadhan2012}, as well as results from Impagliazzo 
and Kabanets~\cite{impagliazzo2010} and Murtagh~\cite{murtagh2018}.}
